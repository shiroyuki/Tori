Configuration
=============

:Author: Juti Noppornpitak

The configuration in Tori framework is written on XML. The only reason is because it is validable and flexible. It is largely 
influenced by the extensive use of Beans in Spring Framework (Java) and the lazy loading in Doctrine (PHP).

.. warning::
    The DTD is not available at the moment. Please follow the example and common sense.

.. warning::
    ``include`` is not yet implemented.

.. note::
    Like a prototype in **Yotsuba** project, :class:`yotsuba.kotoba.Kotoba` is still used for parsing the XML. This will be replaced
    with the selector from **Kotoba** project.
