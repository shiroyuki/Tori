Introduction
************

Tori is a micro framework based on Facebook's Tornado framework 2.x and supports both Python 2.6+, including Python 3.3+.

Before using
------------

Please note that this framework/library is released under MIT license copyrighted by Juti Noppornpitak. The distributed
version of this license is available at https://github.com/shiroyuki/Tori/blob/master/readme.md.

Differences in Idea
-------------------

As you may know that there already exists number of web framework, Tori is made for the different purposes.

1. It is to simplify the setup process.
2. Everything in Tori, beside what Tornado provides, is designed for applications developed on the concepts of
   aspect-oriented programming (AOP) and dependency injections (DI) which heavily relies on `Imagination Framework
   <https://github.com/shiroyuki/Imagination>`_.
3. Free to design the structure of the application in the way everyone wants.
4. Many built-in components are designed for re-usability with or without Tornado and Imagination Framework.

Differences in Code
-------------------

Even though Tori is based on Tornado, there are a few elements that differ from the Tornado.

1. The setup script is different as Tori acts as a wrapper for Tornado's Application.
2. Tori Framework uses `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ as the default template engine.
3. Tori Framework's controller extends Tornado's ``RequestHandler`` with the integration with Tori's session controller.
4. Tori Framework can define more than one route to static resource.

Installation
------------

You can install via **PIP** command or **easy_install** command or you can download the source code
and run ``python setup.py install``.

.. warning::

    There is no plan on supporting the legacy releases of Python as the project moves forward to **Python 3.3 or higher**.
    **Python 2.7** is the last series of Python 2 being supported by the project. **Python 2.6** seems to be working but
    the framework is not tested.
