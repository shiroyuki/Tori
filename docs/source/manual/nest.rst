Nest
****

**Nest** is a command-line script to help you quickly setup an app container. By default, it will be installed on under
``/usr/local/bin`` for most of the system. Run ``nest -h`` for more information.

.. warning:: Nest only works on Python 2.6 and 2.7. It would be fixed in the future release.
