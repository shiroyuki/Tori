Templates
*********

Tori Framework uses `Jinja2 <http://jinja.pocoo.org/>`_ as the default template engine. It is to minimize the
incompatibility between the syntax of the famous Django framework and the irregular syntax of Tornado's default
template engine in case of porting code and reduce the learning curve.
