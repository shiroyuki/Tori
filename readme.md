## Dependencies

- Tornado 2.x

## How to use (by example)

_Note: Tori only simplifies the process for configuration, setup and initialization._

First, check out or clone the code. Then, make sure that `tori` (from `tori`, `doc` and `demo`) is in the path that Python can reach.

Suppose we have the following file structure:

	project/
		app/
			__init__.py
			controller.py
			view.html
		tori # symlink only for development

where `app/controller.py` contains:

	from tornado import web
	class MainController(web.RequestHandler):
		def get(self):
			self.render(
				'views/index.html',
				title="Testing Ground",
				uri=self.request.uri
			)

Now, we write a bootstrap `server.py`:

	from tori.application import Application
	from app import controller
	controller_routing = {
		r'/': controller.MainHandler
	}
	application = Application(controller_routing)
	application.listen(8000).start()

Then, we can start the WSGI server by executing:

	python server.py

Now, you should be able to access http://127.0.0.1:8000.

Please note that the current release only supports for the server mode.
