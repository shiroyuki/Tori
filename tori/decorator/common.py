    Make the given class a singleton class.
    
    *class_reference* is a reference to a class type, not an instance of a class.
    
    *args* and *kwargs* are parameters used to instantiate a singleton instance.
    
    To use this, suppose we have a class called ``DummyClass`` and later instantiate
    a variable ``dummy_instnace`` as an instance of class ``DummyClass``. ``class_reference``
    will be ``DummyClass``, not ``dummy_instance``.
    
    Note that this method is not for direct use. Always use ``@singleton`` or ``@singleton_with``.

    '''
    Decorator to make a class to be a singleton class with given parameters
    for the constructor.
    
    Please note that this decorator always requires parameters. Not giving one
    may result errors. Additionally, it is designed to solve the problem where
    the first parameter is a class reference. For normal usage, please use
    `@singleton` instead.
    
    Example::
    
        # Declaration
        class MyAdapter(AdapterClass):
            def broadcast(self):
                print "Hello, world."
        
        @singleton_with(MyAdapter)
        class MyClass(ParentClass):
            def __init__(self, adapter):
                self.adapter = adapter()
            def take_action(self):
                self.adapter.broadcast()

        # Executing
        MyClass.instance().take_action() # expecting the message on the console.
    
    The end result is that the console will show the number from 1 to 10.

    '''
    Decorator to make a class to be a singleton class. This decorator is
    designed to be able to take parameters for the construction of the
    singleton instance.
    
    Please note that this decorator doesn't support the first parameter
    as a class reference. If you are using that way, please try to use
    ``@singleton_with`` instead.

    Example::
    
        # Declaration
        @singleton
        class MyFirstClass(ParentClass):
            def __init__(self):

            def call(self):
                self.number += 1
                echo self.number
        # Or
        @singleton(20)
        class MySecondClass(ParentClass):
            def __init__(self, init_number):
                self.number = init_number
            def call(self):
                self.number += 1
                echo self.number
        
        # Executing
        for i in range(10):
            MyFirstClass.instance().call()
        # Expecting 1-10 to be printed on the console.
        for i in range(10):
            MySecondClass.instance().call()
        # Expecting 11-20 to be printed on the console.
    
    The end result is that the console will show the number from 1 to 10.
